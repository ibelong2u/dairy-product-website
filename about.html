      <div><p>Our passions are goats and fresh, exquisite cheese.   Honey Creek Creamery is a farmstead operation run by our family.  We purchased George's great grandfather's century farm established in 1891 and moved back to Iowa in 1999.  Goats have been our companions for over 18 years --- mainly for hiking and comic relief.  Sharon formerly worked in Community Development for the Federal Reserve.   In 2006, she made an easy decision to stop traveling, spend time with her daughter and be on the farm to make the most of their life in the Loess Hills.  Sharon became a certified artisan cheese maker in 2009 through a course at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.   Our bunkhouse, built in 1911, was renovated into the processing center and milk parlor and the dairy was off and running as of August 30, 2010.  The goats live a charmed life --- they freely roam and browse the hills and are guarded by sweet Great Pyrenees dogs who stay by their sides day and night.  We are committed to good environmental practices from feeding organic alfalfa, maintaining clean barns and processing rooms and taking daily goat hikes to ensure goats are healthy.  The goal of Honey Creek Creamery is to achieve the best texture, flavor and appearance of cheese by overseeing every detail through making small batches of cheese offered locally.  Loess Hills' vegetation gives our cheese a unique flavor.  We welcome you to try any and all five varieties enhanced by fresh, organic herbs and seasonings.    The Oameks.</p></div>
