		<div id="MainContent1" class="editable"><p>The goat herd is about 35 strong for the 2013 season. &nbsp;Only about
one-half of these are milking goats-- the rest are fixed boys (wethers) kept as
hiking buddies and for weed management on the farm. &nbsp;Goats can stay
"freshened" for two years but the quantity of their milk falls significantly
after about six months. As a result, our&nbsp;cheese business is seasonal
typically going from April - November since we follow the natural cycle of the
goats and breed in the fall with babies born in the spring. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our goats get to roam the Loess Hills and are not confined. &nbsp;After
milking, we go on a hike and they stay up on the ridge until about 4:00 PM when
they come down on their own volition for tasty alfalfa hay. &nbsp;They are
secured at night along with their Great Pyrenees guard buddies. &nbsp;The hikes
provide us an opportunity for a close check-up on the health of the goats on a
daily basis and we are all better for the exercise! &nbsp;</p>
