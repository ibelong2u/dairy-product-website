      <div id="MainContent1" class="editable"><p>Making farmstead cheese truly is a science. Milk properties and composition
change with the seasons as does the taste. In spring when the babies are young,
the milk is more thin. &nbsp;In fall, milk becomes more viscous and creamy.
&nbsp;So -- recipes for cheese need to be tweaked as the character of the milk
changes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Our cheese is unique to anywhere in the world because it is flavored by the
vegetation eaten by the goats in the Loess Hills. &nbsp; Goats' milk can be
used to create the same types of cheese that cows' milk does. &nbsp;What
distinguishes the variety of cheese made is the type of culture and how the
cheese is physically manipulated. &nbsp; Is it cut, put in a salt brine,
aged?</p>

<p>Our chevre takes four days from mama to cheese. &nbsp;Fresh stuff! &nbsp; We
make cheese every two to three days and each day we are working on some stage
of cheese making. &nbsp;Feta will be available in 2013 and it is aged in a salt
brine for 6 weeks.</p>
