		<div id="MainContent1" class="editable"><p>Sharon got her first goats while in Colorado in the 1990s, mainly as hiking
companions (and for comic relief). In 1999, we bought George's great
grandfather's farm established in 1891 and moved to Iowa. The 100 year old
bunkhouse was renovated into the milk parlor and processing plant and still
retains its historic flavor. &nbsp;Honey Creek Creamery Inc. officially became
certified by the state on August 30, 2010 and is the only Iowa certified goat
dairy west of Des Moines. We make fresh chevre every two days and welcome you
to experience the goat cheese's mild flavor derived from Loess Hills vegetation
and enhanced by fresh herbs and seasonings.</p>
