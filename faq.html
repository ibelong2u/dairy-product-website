    <div class="editable" id="MainContent1"><p class="repeatable"><strong>Why goat milk?</strong><br />
Goats' milk is the closest thing to humans' milk, is more nutritious and easier
to digest than cows' milk. Goats are physically smaller and easier to manage.
They are social, loving creatures and true comedians. &nbsp;You can't take life
too seriously with goats!</p>

<p class="repeatable"><strong>Why do goats eat everything?</strong><br />
This is a fallacy. Goats are browsers and, in fact, are very selective eaters.
They prefer to reach up and eat woody stems, leaves and branches. Any wood or
paper product is fair game. &nbsp;If hay is dirty or moldy, they will not eat
it. &nbsp;Routinely our goats selectively pick off the alfalfa leaves and leave
the stems (for the horse to eat). &nbsp;Generally goats do not eat grass -- we
even have to mow their pens!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="repeatable"><strong>How often do you milk?</strong><br />
Goats are milked twice a day--typically 12 hours between each milking. Goats
know their order to be milked and line up accordingly. &nbsp;We use a milk
machine and currently milk about 15 goats. &nbsp;Each goat takes about 5-10
minutes to milk so each milking takes about 1-1/2 hours.</p>

<p class="repeatable"><strong><strong>What kinds of goats do you
have?</strong><br /></strong>We have three breeds of goats: &nbsp;Nubians,
Saanens and Alpines. All were selected for specific reasons -- Nubians have
higher butterfat in the milk and both Saanen and Alpine produce larger
quantities of milk.</p>

<p class="repeatable"><strong>How long does the cheese last?</strong>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fresh chevre lasts about 3 weeks.
&nbsp;It also freezes well (particularly in our containers). &nbsp;If frozen,
defrosit the cheese in the refrigerator for a day. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="repeatable"><strong>Is the cheese pasteurized?</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Yes -- Iowa law requires pasteurization. &nbsp;This means the milk is heated up
to 145 degrees for thirty minutes. &nbsp;This process destroys harmful bacteria
while keeping the nutritive value of the milk. &nbsp;</p>
